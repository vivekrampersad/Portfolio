### 🧠 About
I build and integrate robotics and automation systems at scale—AMR fleets, AGVs, AS/RS, conveyors, and high‑availability PLC/HMI/SCADA stacks—fusing **ROS/ROS2**, **Python/C++**, and **Ignition SCADA** with **MES/WMS** orchestration. I deliver resilient motion, calibration, and networking, and ship **digital twins** that de‑risk deployments and save real money.

## 💼 Experience (Robotics + Software)

<details>
<summary><b>Senior Applications/System Engineer — Zebra Robotics Automation (Oct 2024 – Present)</b></summary>

- **AMR fleet engineering:** Planned, deployed, and commissioned **Zebra (Fetch) AMR** fleets; tuned navigation, localization, and traffic management for throughput and safety.
- **Systems integration:** Orchestrated PLC/MES/WMS interfaces; built robust API/Webhook bridges and message routing (MQTT/REST) to unify fleet + WMS events.
- **DevOps for robots:** Authored **Python + Ansible** scripts for reliable multi‑robot config management, logs, KPI export; automated updates and health checks.
- **Wireless reliability:** Site surveys and Wi‑Fi analysis (NetSpot/Wireshark) to eliminate roaming dead‑zones, reduce packet loss, and stabilize QoS telemetry.
- **Acceptance & governance:** Owned FAT/SAT/UAT and vendor coordination; ensured change control, rollback plans, and documentation (SOPs).

<summary><b>Senior Programmer Analyst — LCBO (Aug 2019 – Oct 2024)</b></summary>

- **Warehouse control software:** Maintained and enhanced **real‑time WCS** integrating AGVs, conveyors, palletizers, cranes, and AS/RS with upstream **WMS/WES**.
- **Digital twin for PLC I/O:** Built a **Python‑based PLC I/O emulator** for pallet handling to validate logic offline—reducing risk and saving ≈ **$300K/year**.
- **Ignition SCADA HMIs:** Engineered operator dashboards and analytics views aggregating telemetry from AGVs/conveyors/cranes for actionable visibility.
- **Modernization:** Led migration from legacy controls to **Rockwell ControlLogix**; validated via Ignition + SoftLogix simulation and protocol analysis (Wireshark).
- **SRE practices:** Incident triage, root cause analysis, test harnesses, and SOPs to prevent recurrence and improve MTTR.

**Demos — LCBO / Ignition / Automation**
