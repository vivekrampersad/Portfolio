## 🔎 Featured Work (Short Highlights)

- **Digital Twin for PLC I/O**  
  Built a Python-based simulation platform to emulate pallet handling operations for a large automated warehouse—**saving ~\$300,000 CAD annually** by eliminating risky in-production testing.  
  _Tech:_ Python, ControlLogix, Ignition, Grafana, Wireshark

- **AMR Fleet Deployment & Integration**  
  Led **end-to-end** deployment/integration of **Zebra AMRs** across multiple sites; integrated with **MES/WMS** and **PLC orchestration**, implemented KPIs through logs/APIs, improved fleet reliability.  
  _Tech:_ ROS/ROS2, REST APIs, MQTT, Grafana, Python, Ansible

- **ROS Simulation for Field Robots**  
  Modeled and validated robot performance across new environments **pre-deployment**, reduced commissioning risk and time; formalized **ECR** and **incident triage** in Jira.  
  _Tech:_ ROS, Gazebo, Python, Jira

> I’m currently working on public, generalized versions of these projects. Watch this space for repositories!
